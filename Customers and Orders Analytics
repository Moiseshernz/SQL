--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

-- #1 How many orders were made in January
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

-- #2 How many iPhone orders were made in January
SELECT COUNT(Product) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = "iPhone";

-- #3 Customers acc numbers for february sales
SELECT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers c
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales f
ON c.order_id = f.orderID;

-- #4 Which was the cheapest product sold in January and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, MIN(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan ;

-- #5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

-- #6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue
SELECT DISTINCT Product, Quantity, SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101";

-- #7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price) AS avg_spent FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE feb.quantity > 2;
