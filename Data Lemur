--1 In this query I tasked with finding the candidates best suited for an open Data Science job.
--I listed the candidates who possess all of the required skills for the job by ID in ascending order. 
SELECT candidate_id 
FROM candidates
WHERE skill IN ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL')
GROUP BY candidate_id
HAVING COUNT(skill) = 3
ORDER BY candidate_id
;

--2 In this query I returned the page IDs of all the Facebook pages that don't have any likes in the database.
SELECT p.page_id 
FROM page_likes pl
FULL OUTER JOIN pages p ON p.page_id = pl.page_id
WHERE liked_date IS NULL
ORDER BY p.page_id ASC
;
